SINGAPORE: Bus and train fares will go up by 10 cents per journey for adult commuters from Dec 28, the Public Transport Council (PTC) announced on Monday (Sep 9) after its annual fare review exercise.

For concession card holders such as students, seniors and people with disabilities, their public transport fares will increase by 4 cents per journey. 

There will be no changes for people who travel with monthly passes.

Overall, fares will go up by 6 per cent - less than the 7 per cent increase last year when adult fares rose by 10 to 11 cents per journey. 

Lower-income households will get public transport vouchers, which can be used to top up fare cards or buy monthly passes. The vouchers this year will be worth S$60 each, compared with the S$50 in vouchers provided last year. 

The income criteria for the vouchers will also be raised and made available to households with a monthly household income per person of not more than S$1,800, up from the previous S$1,600. 

An additional 60,000 households will stand to benefit from the vouchers as a result. 

WHY FARES ARE GOING UP
Explaining the increase, the PTC - Singapore's regulator for public transport fares - said the decision was driven by core inflation and wage growth in 2023. But this was partially moderated by a drop in energy prices from a peak in 2022.

These three factors form part of PTC's fare adjustment formula, which derived a 3.3 per cent increase in fares based on inflation, wages and energy prices.

On top of that, there is a deferred fare increase quantum of 15.6 per cent from previous years, meaning the maximum allowable fare adjustment this round is 18.9 per cent. 

The PTC then decided on a 6 per cent rise, which is less than one-third of the maximum allowable fare increase. 

This is to cushion commuters from the full fare increase, with the agency saying that it understands that the cost of living remains a concern for Singaporeans.

Chairperson of the PTC Janet Ang said the reason for the deferred fare quantum of 15.6 per cent was because the agency did not grant the maximum allowable increase “as much as we can” to ease the impact on commuters. 

“As a result, the deferred quantum from previous years has accumulated, due to sharp increases in energy prices in 2021 and 2022, elevated core inflation, and strong wage growth,” she said.  

This is the second fare review exercise under the new fare adjustment formula that was announced in April last year.

The new formula is aimed at keeping fares affordable and less volatile, the PTC said then, as two components were fixed to reduce swings in fare changes.
